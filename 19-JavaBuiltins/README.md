HashMap is an implemnetation of Map and HashSet is an implementation of Set. In HashMap, it stores a key and value pair whereas the HashSet only stores objects.

HashMaps use an array of linked lists in order to store the values.

TreeMaps are implemented with a red black tree.

TreeMap is faster than HashMap when adding 1000000 items.

The built in java heap  is called PriorityQueue.
